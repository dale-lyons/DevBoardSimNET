;
;- - - HARDWARE - - -
;
;The Hardware is comprised of up to three boards, the CPU board, SIO board and Front Panel (FP) board.
;
;CPU Board:
; Z80 CPU, 4Mhz Clock, 5V Regulator, 32K EPROM (w/firmware), 32K RAM, 8 bit input port, 8 bit output port
;
;SIO Board:
; Additional RAM, up to 512K bytes to bank switch the lower 32K ROM on CPU Board
; ACE 8250 UART with RS-232 or FTDI232 (5V TTL Level) connection
; Micro SD Card Slot
;
;Front Panel Board:
; Terminal for Power & RS-232 connection, Timer for 1mSec interrupt, LED Display Driver & Keyboard Matrix.
;
; LED Display: 7 x 7-Segment displays (d1 to d7) and 7 annunciator leds (x1 to x7) below the 7 digits.
;
;    d1   d2   d3   d4   d5   d6   d7

;    x1  x2     x3  x4    x5  x6    x7
;
; Keyboard: 16 keys labeled "0" to "F" designated as a HEX keyboard
; The "F" key is wired to a separate input line, so it can be used as a "Shift" key to produce an extended number of key codes.
; The "F" and "0" keys are also wired directly to an AND gate, so that pressing both these keys produces a HARD reset.
;
;- - - FIRMWARE - - -
;
;The Firmware provides a means to control the system through two interfaces.
;Control is reading/writing to memory, registers, I/O ports; having the Z80 execute programs in memory or halting execution.
;The two interfaces are:
; 1. The Keyboard and LED display
; 2. A terminal (or PC) connected at 9600,N,8,1 to the RS-232 port.
;
;- - - The Keyboard and LED display interface - - -
;
;While entering commands or data, the annunciator LED's will light according to the state of the operation or system as follows:
;
; x1 = Enter Register
; x2 = Enter Memory Location
; x3 = Alter Memory/Register
; x4 = Send Data to Output Port
; x5 = Monitor Mode (Default Mode upon Power up)
; x6 = Run Mode
; x7 = Beeper (on key press)
;
;Keyboard Functions:
;
; "F" & "0" - Force a HARD reset to the Z80 and restarts the system.  See System Starting for additional details.
;
; "0" - Display a Register.  x1 lights and you have a few seconds to select which register to display.
; "E" - Display Memory.  x2 lights and you have a few seconds to enter a memory location.
; "5" - Display Input Port.  x2 lights and you have a few seconds to enter a port address.
; "6" - Output Port. x2 lights and you have a few seconds to enter a port address,
;	then x4 lights and you can enter data to output, new data may be sent while x4 remains lit.
; "A" - Advance Display Element.  Advances to next Register, Memory address or Port address.
; "B" - Backup Display Element.  Backs up to previous Register, Memory address or Port address.
; "4" - Go. Preloads all the registers including the PC, thus causes execution at the current PC register.
; "7" - Single Step.
; "D" - Alter/Output.  Depending on the display, Selects a different Register, Memory Address, Port or Sends Port Output.
;	Note, "D" will only send to that Output Port, to change port, reuse Command 6.
; "F" & "E" - Does a SOFT reset when Running.
;
;
;- - - The Terminal interface - - -
;
;Through a Terminal, there are more features you can use.  Entering a question mark (?) or another unrecognized command will display a list of available commands.
;Most commands are easy to understand, given here are the few which could use a better explaination.
;
; C - Continous Dump.	Works like the D command but without pausing on the page boundaries.  This is to allow the text capturing of a dump.
;			The captured file can then be later sent back to the system by simply sending the text file through an ASCII upload.
; M - Multiple Input.	Allows the entering of data in a format that was previously sent & saved in an ASCII text file.
; R - Register.		Entering R without specifiying the register will display all the registers.
;			A specific register can be displayed or set if specified.  eg. R HL<CR>, R HL=1234<CR>
; T - Test RAM		Specify the first and last page to test, eg T 80 8F will test RAM from 8000 to 8FFF.
; X - Xmodem Transfers	Transfers a binary file through the XModem protocol.  Enter the command, then configure your PC to receive or send a file.
;			eg. X U 8000<CR> will transfer a file from your PC to the RAM starting at 8000 for the length of the file (rounded up to the next 128 byte block).
;			eg. X D 8000 0010 will transfer a file from RAM to your PC, starting at 8000 for 10 (16 decimal) blocks, hence file size = 2K.
; : - ASCII HEX Upload	The ":" character is not entered manually, it is part of the Intel HEX file you can upload through ASCII upload.
;			eg. While at the prompt, just instruct your terminal program to ASCII upload (or send text file) a .HEX file.
;
;
;- - - System Starting - - -
;When the Z80 starts execution of the firmware at 0000, all the registers are saved to memory for examination or modification.
;There are many ways the Z80 can come to execute at 0000.  The firmware tries to deterimine the cause of the start up and will respond differently.
;Regardless of why, the firmware first saves all the registers to RAM and saves the last Stack word *assuming* it was the PC.
;A test is done to check if the FP board or SIO board is present.
;-If there is no FP board, then the firmware will either RUN code in RAM @8002 (if there's a valid signature of 2F8 @8000) or HALT.
;Next, 8 bytes of RAM is tested & set for/with a signature.
;-If there isn't a signature, it is assumed the system is starting from a powered up condition (COLD Start), no further testing is done.
;When the signature is good (WARM Start), more tests are done as follows:
;Test Keyboard for "F"&"E" = Soft Reset from Keyboard
;Test Keyboard for "F"|"0" = Hard Reset from Keyboard
;Test Last instruction executed (assuming PC was on Stack) for RST 0 (C7) = Code Break
;Test RS-232 Buffer for Ctrl-C (03) = Soft Reset from Terminal
;If cause cannot be deterimined, it is assumed an external source asserted the RESET line.
;
;The Display will indicate the cause of reset as:
;	"COLD 00"  (Power up detected by lack of RAM Signature)
;	"SOFT ##"  (F-E keys pressed)
;	"STEP ##"  (Single Step)
;	"^C   ##"  (Ctrl-C)
;	"HALT ##"  (HALT Instruction executed)
;	"F-0  ##"  (F-0 Hard Reset)
;	"RST0 ##"  (RST0 Instruction executed)
;	"HARD ##"  (HARD Reset by other)
;
;Where the number after the reset shows the total number of resets.
;
;The PC will be changed to 8000 on Cold resets.
;
;
;- - - Firmware BIOS - - -
;
;There are routines which can be called from your program to access the RS-232 Bit banging interface, Keyboard or Display inteface or Timer interrupt services.
;
;Label		Addr.	Description
;Put_Char	xxxx	Sends the ASCII character in A to the RS-232 port or LED Display (no registers, including A, are affected)
;Put_HEX	xxxx	Converts the low nibble of A to an ASCII character 0 to F and sends to RS-232 or LED Display
;Put_Byte	xxxx	Converts/sends both high and low nibbles of A (sends 2 ASCII Character) to RS-232 or LED Display

;Memory Mapping
;
;0x0000 - 0x7FFF	EPROM or RAM (BANK SWITCHED)
;0x8000 - 0xFFFF	RAM

; Notes on Z80MC CPU board.
; Memory Mapping
; Holding /ROM high will inhibit the ROM from being enabled on the Data bus.
; Holding /RAM high will inhibit the RAM from being enabled on the Data bus.
; /ROM is loosely pulled low on Memrq & A15 low (ie, ROM 0000-7FFF)
; /RAM is loosely pulled low on Memrq & A15 high (ie, RAM 8000-FFFF)
; 
; 
; Notes on Z80 SRS board.
; Memory (SDC-RAM)
; The RAM on the SD card and the /ROM signal for the CPU board are both generated by U4.
; The Y output is the value of the addressed Data input pin or Low if strobe (G) is high.
; The W output is always the inverted value of Y.
; Y goes to /ROM and W goes to RAM /CE.  
; Therefore, when Y is high /ROM is inhibited and RAM /CE is low
; When Y is low /ROM is unhindered (and ROM is allowed to be accessed on A15=0)
; 
; When NOT requesting any Memory operation, /MREQ=1, Y is LOW.  This is irrelevant to
; the CPU ROM and RAM, but it ensures that the SDC-RAM is NOT enabled.
; With A15=0:
;  >Reading, Y is controled by Q1 (0=ROM, 1=RAM)
;  >Writing, Y is high, thus SDC-RAM is enabled to accept the write
;  
; With A15=1:
;  >Reading or Writing, Y is low, thus SDC-RAM is disabled and CPU-RAM is enabled
 

; Notes on Z80MC CPU board.
; I/O Mapping
; /OUT is loosely pulled low on A7 low, A6 high, A5 low and /WR low  (ie, 40-5F)
; /IN  is loosely pulled low on A7 low, A6 high, A5 low and /RD low  (ie, 40-5F)

;* The character-receive subroutine should be called with a

;  After receiving the <soh>, the receiver should call the

;remainder of the message and the <cksum>.  Since they are sent
;as a continuous stream, timing out of this implies a serious
;like glitch that caused, say, 127 characters to be seen instead
;of 128.
;
;* When the receiver wishes to <nak>, it should call a "PURGE"
;subroutine, to wait for the line to clear.  Recall the sender
;tosses any characters in its UART buffer immediately upon
;completing sending a block, to ensure no glitches were mis-
;interpreted.
;  The most common technique is for "PURGE" to call the
;character receive subroutine, specifying a 1-second timeout,
;and looping back to PURGE until a timeout occurs.  The <nak> is
;then sent, ensuring the other end will see it.
;
;* You may wish to add code recommended by Jonh Mahr to your
;character receive routine - to set an error flag if the UART
;shows framing error, or overrun.  This will help catch a few
;more glitches - the most common of which is a hit in the high
;bits of the byte in two consecutive bytes.  The <cksum> comes
;out OK since counting in 1-byte produces the same result of
;adding 80H + 80H as with adding 00H + 00H.
